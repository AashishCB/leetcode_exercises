# LeetCode Practice Exercises Solutions in Python

Welcome to my personal repository of LeetCode solutions! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python. These solutions reflect my journey and progress in solving algorithmic challenges.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of my practice solutions for LeetCode problems. Each solution is written in Python. Various approaches are taken to achieve solution and marked as def 'function_v1(), function_v2().. function()'. The function without 'v1, v2...or vn' has the most optimal solution.

## How to Use

Each solution is a standalone Python script. To run a solution, simply execute the script using the Python interpreter. For example:

```sh
python "Arrays 101/duplicate zeroes.py"
